# Aliexpress_scraping
Something very interesting and usefull about Aliexpress, is that you can know how many times certain products has been bought, so for someone who wants to sale on that platform or someone who is curious about certain niches or products, will take several hours to extract valuable information. With that idea on mind I prepared this code that allows you to extract valuable information. 

## How to use
On Aliexpress, make a search and introduce that link, is also posible to select how many page to scrap. 

## Comments
As my porpouse was to use it with the spanish site of Aliexpress is possible that will not work properly with other language, but will be necesary just to modify a couple lines of code to make it work with other languages.
