# Aliexpress_scraping
Something very interesting and useful about Aliexpress is that you can know how many times certain products have been bought, so for someone who wants to sale on that platform or someone who is curious about certain niches or products, will take several hours to extract valuable information. With that idea in mind, I prepared this code that allows you to extract valuable information.

## How to use
On Aliexpress, make a search and introduce that link, is also possible to select how many pages to scrap.

## Comments
As my purpose was to use it with the Spanish site of Aliexpress is possible that will not work properly with other language but will be necessary just to modify a couple of lines of code to make it work with other languages.
